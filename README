This is a collection of sample problem solutions for the
Google Code Jam competitions. These programming puzzles are interesting searching
and sorting problems.

To solve a new problem, I create a copy of
codejamtemplate.erl
and modify it as appropriate. The template covers the basic I/O stuff for reading
plain text data files that code jam problems commonly use and outputs results
generated by the solving method in a commond format.

See http://code.google.com/codejam/ for the problem sets

Complete and accurate solutions:

africa2010storecredit.erl - Qual Round 2010 Problem A
codejamalienlang.erl      - Qual Round 2009 Problem A
codejamminscalar.erl      - Round 1A 2008 Problem A
codejamtongues.erl        - Qual Round 2012 Problem A
codejamrecycle.erl        - Qual Round 2012 Problem C

In Progress:
codejamwelcome.erl - Horribly slow recursive solution, accurate for the sample but
  doesn't complete in reasonable time on small-practice
