This is a collection of problem solutions for the
Google Code Jam competitions. These programming puzzles 
generally fall into searching and sorting problems.

To solve a new problem, I create a copy of
codejamtemplate.erl
and modify it as appropriate. The template covers the basic I/O stuff for reading
plain text data files that code jam problems commonly use, and outputs the results
generated by the solving method in a common format.

See http://code.google.com/codejam/ for the problem sets

Complete and accurate solutions:

africa2010storecredit.erl - Qual Round 2010 Problem A
codejamalienlang.erl      - Qual Round 2009 Problem A
codejamminscalar.erl      - Round 1A 2008 Problem A
codejamrecycle.erl        - Qual Round 2012 Problem C
codejamtongues.erl        - Qual Round 2012 Problem A
codejamwelcome2.erl       - Qual Round 2009 Problem C

In Progress:
codejamrush.erl - Round 1A 2012 Problem B
  Close but not quite perfect solution. Need to sort levels before picking.
  
Retired:
codejamwelcome.erl - Qual Round 2009 Problem C
  Horribly slow recursive solution, accurate for the sample but
  doesn't complete in reasonable time on small-practice. Scrapped and re-written
  as codejamwelcome2
