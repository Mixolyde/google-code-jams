This is a collection of sample problem solutions for the
Google Code Jam competitions. These are mostly interesting searching
and sorting problems.

To solve a new problem, I create a copy of
codejamtemplate.erl
and modify it as appropriate.

See http://code.google.com/codejam/ for the problem sets

Complete and accurate solutions:

africa2010storecredit.erl
codejamalienlang.erl
codejamminscalar.erl

In Progress:
codejamwelcome.erl - Horribly slow recursive solution, accurate for the sample but
  doesn't complete in reasonable time on small-practice
